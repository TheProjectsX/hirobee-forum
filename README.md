# Hirobee – A Full Stack (MERN) Forum Website

Originally started as a Redux practice project, Hirobee evolved into a fully functional, production-ready forum platform inspired by Reddit.
The name “Hirobee” comes from the Japanese word Hiroba (広場), meaning “public square” or “plaza” — a place for open discussion and gathering.
