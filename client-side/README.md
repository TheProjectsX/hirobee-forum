### Some lessons

-   Don't Try to do the things easy way. It becomes a hassle in the long run and makes you want to think about your life goals
-   Drilled Up state (via hook) is not a good idea. You haven't been able to solve the issue. Rerenders Happen, and it's not a Good thing
-   Redux is Awesome
